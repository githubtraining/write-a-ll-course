### Validation

The events that can act as triggers help Learning Lab know when something happens. However, sometimes knowing it happened isn't enough. For example, if we ask a learner to commit a function to a file, we'll get a trigger that they've committed to a branch. But we would receive the same trigger, even if they committed to a different file!

Course authors can use **gates** to be validate the user's completion of a step. A [:book: `gate`](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/gate/) is a Learning Lab action. Gates are conditionals, and they behave much like a conditional in Javascript. Let's add a `gate`, we'll specify its options in a later step.

## Step 11: Add a gate

Let's now validate the learner's PR. We asked them to title the pull request "Add name to README" so that's what we need to validate against.
